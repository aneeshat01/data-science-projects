# Data Science Projects

This repository contains data science projects that I have completed. In these projects, I use Python and SQL to scrape, clean, manipulate, and display data. You can
find more detailed descriptions of each project below.

# Solar Flares
In this project I used the pandas and beautifulsoup packages to scrape and tidy solar flare data from two different sources: SpaceWeatherLive and NASA. 

# Moneyball
