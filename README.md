# Data Science Projects

This repository contains data science projects that I have completed. In these projects, I use Python and SQL to scrape, clean, manipulate, and display data. You can
find more detailed descriptions of each project below.

# Solar Flares
In this project, I used the pandas and beautifulsoup packages to scrape, tidy, and organize solar flare data from two different sources: SpaceWeatherLive (SWL) and NASA. Once the data was collected and organized, I was able to manipulate it in various different ways. For example, I was able to isolate a specific class of solar flare and find commonalities between the SWL data and NASA data.

# Moneyball
In this project, I used SQL queries, pandas, and numpy to scrape data from the 2014 baseball season about team salaries and wins/losses. I used this data to discern which teams were spending most efficiently- that is, which teams were paying the least for the highest proportion of wins in a season. I also used matplotlib heavily to plot my findings and make it clear to see trends in the data.
